# Fuse Android Foreign Code Basics Example
Example project to accompany the "[Foreign Code Basics - Part 2 (Android)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AoCdAKPLn4)" Fuse tutorial video. This is a super simple app that uses foreign code to play a system sound on Android devices.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse (beta) v0.10.0 (build 6044).

## Branches
The "finished product" is on the `master` branch, and the template I started with in the video is on the `starting-template` branch.
